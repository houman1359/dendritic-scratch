Dendritic Modeling is a powerful neural network library designed to simulate complex dendritic computations inspired by biological neurons. This package provides an innovative approach to understanding how neurons integrate excitatory and inhibitory signals at the branch and soma levels, offering users a flexible platform to explore dendritic processing in artificial neural networks. By mimicking the nuanced interactions within real neurons, Dendritic Modeling enables researchers to investigate how dynamic, localized computations influence learning and behavior in neural systems. The package supports modular network construction, fine-grained parameter control, and customizable reactivation functions, making it highly adaptable to diverse experimental setups.

Ideal for neuroscience researchers, Dendritic Modeling integrates seamlessly with PyTorch, leveraging the familiar tools and scalability of this widely-used deep learning framework. The package includes an excitation-inhibition network architecture, which models intricate interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and a probabilistic classification layer, designed to support both deterministic and stochastic predictions. Comprehensive documentation, including tutorials and API references, makes Dendritic Modeling package accessible to users at all levels, from beginners to experienced researchers aiming to bridge the gap between artificial intelligence and biological plausibility.
