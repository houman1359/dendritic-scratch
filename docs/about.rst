The goal of the Dendritic Modeling codebase is to define dendritic neural network models, based on the biological and morphological models of neurons and how excitatory and inhibitory synapses are processing signals in the neuron. 
By adding the shunting mechanisms, which are reminiscent of biological processes observed in dendritic computation, we aim to better understand how real neuronal networks work and use this information to design better networks based on dendritic neuronal units.
